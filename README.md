# Modera - ML System Design

## 1. Project Overview

**Modera** is an innovative virtual fitting room service that leverages Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies to assist users in selecting clothing, footwear, and accessories online. The platform analyzes users' body measurements, recommends the best-fitting sizes and styles, and allows them to virtually try on items. **Modera** aims to enhance customer confidence in their online shopping experience, reduce returns, and improve user satisfaction.

### 2. Key Technologies
- **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**: Machine learning models for personalized recommendations and size suggestions.
- **Augmented Reality (AR)**: Enabling virtual try-on of products.
- **Computer Vision**: Body analysis from user-uploaded images or videos.
- **Recommendation Systems**: Based on user preferences and past behavior.

## 3. Project Domain

- **E-commerce**
- **AI & Machine Learning**
- **Augmented Reality (AR)**
- **Virtual Fitting Room**
- **Personalization in Shopping**

## 4. System Workflow

### 4.1 Body Scanning
- **Input**: Users upload photos or videos to create a virtual body model.
- **Processing**:
  - Preprocessing: Image and video normalization.
  - Pose Estimation: Identify key body points and extract measurements.
  - Body Modeling: Create a 3D body model using computer vision algorithms.
  
### 4.2 Body Parameter Analysis
- **Input**: Virtual body model generated from the scanning process.
- **Processing**:
  - Analyze body shape and dimensions.
  - Cross-reference user measurements with product data (e.g., clothing sizes).
  
### 4.3 Virtual Try-on (AR)
- **Input**: User selects clothing, footwear, or accessories from the catalog.
- **Processing**:
  - Overlay virtual clothing on the user's 3D body model using AR.
  - Ensure realistic fitting and movement simulation.
  
### 4.4 Personalized Recommendations
- **Input**: User preferences, past purchases, and body analysis.
- **Processing**:
  - Recommender system predicts preferred sizes, styles, and brands.
  - Personalization engine suggests products based on body measurements and fashion trends.

## 5. Key Components

- **Data Pipeline**: 
  - Collect user images/videos.
  - Preprocess data for use in computer vision and recommendation models.
  
- **Machine Learning Models**:
  - **Pose Estimation Model**: Extracts key body points from photos/videos.
  - **Body Shape Prediction Model**: Generates a virtual body model.
  - **Recommender System**: Uses collaborative filtering and content-based filtering to suggest clothing items based on body measurements and user preferences.

- **Augmented Reality (AR) Engine**: Renders virtual try-ons with realistic simulation of clothing fit and behavior.
  
- **Backend Services**:
  - Handles user data storage (body models, preferences).
  - Integrates with product databases (sizes, styles).

## 6. Expected Outcomes

- **Improved Shopping Experience**: Users can confidently select clothing and accessories that fit their body without physical try-ons.
- **Increased Customer Satisfaction**: Reducing the number of product returns by providing accurate size recommendations.
- **Enhanced Personalization**: AI-driven recommendations that align with users' fashion preferences and past behavior.
  
## 7. Future Enhancements

- **Advanced AR Features**: Improvements in the realism of the virtual try-on experience (e.g., fabric simulation, lighting effects).
- **AI Model Refinements**: Incorporating feedback loops to improve recommendation accuracy based on return data and customer feedback.
- **Multilingual Support**: Expanding accessibility for a global user base.
